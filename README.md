# Plane Vector Class

A custom class for modeling vectors in the plane. Supports L2 norm, polar angle,
addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and dot product.

Additionally, the model includes a function for determining the angle between two vectors.

This class was designed to demonstrate the use of special methods in Python for
North Bergen High School's STEM Academy. `vector.py` serves as a starting point
for building a more general and more robust `Vector` class.
